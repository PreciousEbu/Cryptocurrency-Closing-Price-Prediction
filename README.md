# Cryptocurrency-Closing-Price-Prediction
A Project on Financial data. In this project, we made use of machine learning to build models that try to predict the closing price based a number of features

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
Crypto currency is a digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services but uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to secure online transactions. Much of the interest in these unregulated currencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward. Some of the most popular crypto currencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance coin, tether, cardano, dogecoin. Crypto currencies work using a technology called blockchain.
With the boom and bust of crypto currency prices in recent years, crypto currencies have been increasingly regarded as an investment asset. Crypto currencies may go up in value but many investors see them as mere speculations, not real investments. This is because they generate no cash flow, so for you to profit, someone has to pay more for the currency than you did.

However, crypto currency is highly unstable, incredibly speculative and a volatile purchase, a major downside which has caused notable voices in the investment community to advice investors to steer clear of them. The price volatility creates a dilemma. For instance, the most popular crypto currency called Bitcoin, has had volatile price moves this year (2021) reaching nearly $65,000 in April before losing nearly half its value in May.
There are many factors and constraints that can be taken into consideration when trying to predict increasing or decreasing crypto currency prices. These include the different stakeholders such as media, tweets, social impact, news etc. Because of their highly volatile nature, there is a need for good predictions on which to base investment decisions.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Crypto currencies have a highly volatile nature and makes their prices unpredictable. This is because the market is still new and the industry is still unfamiliar to a lot of people. This volatility petrifies new entrants from entering the crypto currency markets and has caused losses to investors. Hence, there is a need for good predictions to prevent future losses. In this project, we are interested in applying different modeling techniques to the provided data sets and dimensional features to achieve an optimization in crypto currency price prediction.

# AIMS OF THE PROJECT
•	To leverage machine learning for more accurate crypto currency price prediction.

•	To apply different modelling techniques to different data structures and dimensional features to achieve an optimization in crypto currency price prediction.

•	To build a model that optimally forecasts crypto currency's closing price and prevents losses.

# TYPE OF PROBLEM
This is a predictive regression problem based on the nature of the target variable which is continuous.

# DATA SOURCE
Zindi Africa

# METHODOLOGY
Since this is a regression problem, in this project, gradient boosting algorithms and tree algorithms for regression capable of supervised machine learning were used to develop the models and evaluation was done using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The selected model was that with the lowest RMSE and was used to predict the test data.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
From the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), it was observed that these important features are positively skewed distributions. In real life finance, this positive skewness indicates frequent small losses and a few large gains for investors as there is some probability to gain huge profits that can cover all the frequent losses. Thus, making them important predictors and corroborating their importance in from feature importance.
Based on model performance, it is evident that machine learning algorithms can be used to build models that can predict closing price and save huge investment losses.

# METRICS
•	RMSE

# RECOMMENDATION
•	Crypto currency is volatile but showed the tendency to be more volatile and unstable when closing price is around 10,000 Thus, investors should exercise caution when trading at that closing price to prevent huge losses.

•	Further investigation should be done on why crypto currency is high unstable at 10000 closing price.
• Also, more features should be investigated as to how they affect cryptocurrency
