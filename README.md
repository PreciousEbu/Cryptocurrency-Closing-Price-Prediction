## Cryptocurrency Closing Price Prediction

This repository contains the code and data for a project that aims to predict the closing price of cryptocurrencies using machine learning techniques.

### Installation:

#### Clone this repository:
[git clone https://github.com/cryptocurrency-closing-price-prediction.git](https://github.com/PreciousEbu/Cryptocurrency-Closing-Price-Prediction.git)

#### Install the required Python libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn
Running the Code:

#### Run the main.py script:
python main.py
This will train the model, make predictions on the test data, and generate a submission file for a competition.

### Data:

The data used in this project is gotten from Zindi Africa.
The data files are located in the data folder.

### Model:

The model is based on Linear Regression and Random forest regression algorithms.
The model is selected based on its performance on the validation set, measured by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.

### Results:

The model achieved a promising level of accuracy on the test data.
The project report provides a detailed analysis of the findings and techniques employed
